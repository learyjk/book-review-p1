Basic website to gain more experience with Python and Flask using SQL to interact with a database.  Additionally, just getting started with APIs so use Goodreads API to pull some data about a book (reviews) as well as make provide my own API data when a user sends a get request using
https://book-review-50.herokuapp.com/api/<insert ISBN>

Future improvements:
1. UI enhancement.  Especially the HTML forms that span the whole page.
2. Data validation/requirements.  Yes, this web app will let you use a 1 character password and fake email addresses.  If it's that bad I imagine it gets worse but hey it meets the project spec.
