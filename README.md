# Project 1 Book Review

CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a book review website to satisfy the requirements for CS50 Web Project 1.  Users can log in and search for titles to leave reviews and read reviews by others.  Additionally, it utilizes the Goodreads API to pull reviews from a larger sample size.

The purpose of this project is to further familiarize myself with Flask, Python, Postgres database and SQL commands, Heroku deployments, and APIs.  As mentioned above, it pulls data from the Goodreads API and also generates its own API data when a user sends a GET request to: https://book-review-50.herokuapp.com/api/<insert ISBN>
